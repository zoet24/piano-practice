# piano-practice

## TOZOs:

- Tweak layout of chord table in mobile and desktop
- Change layout of chord modal > longer keyboard, numbers over LH and RH
- Work out how to do stuff like E/C
- Once you have a good chord table that is working well, add navigation and add test mode (should have inital UI where you can set chords to be included, number of chords in test, summary afterwards where you can mark what you still need to practice)
- Once that is working well, add in local storage
- Once that is working well, repeat for scales
